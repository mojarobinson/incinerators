            US trash incinerators can damage human and ecological health.
            Moreover, they hardly make any profits as it's expensive to
            maintain. These trash burning facilities are strategically placed in
            underdeveloped areas, where there is less socio-political power to
            investigate these harmful plants. These areas are considered
            sacrifice zones or areas that are permanently impaired by heavy
            environmental alterations or economic disinvestment, often through
            locally unwanted land use for the greater good of the entire region
            (e.g., South Bronx and Manhattan). Sacrifice zones are purposely
            positioned in low-income and communities of color because these
            communities tend to have less economic and political power to fight
            the placement of things like waste facilities, highways,
            petrochemical businesses, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sacrifice zones have been going on since Emancipation Proclamation
            but became popular after The National Housing Act of 1934, where
            redlining was introduced and then justified by the Federal Housing
            Administration in the 1960s. This sparked the environmental justice
            movement, led by environmental justice communities (EJC), which are
            communities most impacted by environmental harms and risks. The same
            people who live and work in sacrifice zones. This map tells the
            story of the correlation between EJC health and trash incinerators.

<p>Methodology: EJ communities were defined by locally enacted legislation, adopted policy, 
      or proposed law. All of which were focused on racial demographics and income.</p>

<p>A 3-mile buffer was used to determine if the incinerator was in an EJ community.</p>
